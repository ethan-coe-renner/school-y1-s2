              Two Sample t-test
      data:  gpa by business_major
      t = 1.907, df = 113, p-value = 0.05906
      alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
      95 percent confidence interval:
       -0.01248409  0.65447513
      sample estimates:
          mean in group Business Major mean in group Not Business Major 
                              3.401136                         3.080141 

      #+end_example

      with a p-value of 0.059*2 > 0.05, we fail to reject the null and conclude that there is no significant difference between the gpa of business and non-business majors.
