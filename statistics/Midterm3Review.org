* Module 4: Confidence Intervals for Proportions and Means
pnorm(z) gives the area to the left of the z value in the cdf function

qnorm(p) gives the z value with p area to the left in the cdf function

$z=\frac{value-mean}{SD}$

| Statistic | Sample Proportion: $\hat{p}$ | Sample mean \overline{X}      |
|-----------+----------------------------+---------------------------|
| EV        | p                          | \mu                       |
| SE        | $\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$  | $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ |

** Ex: Netflix
In a random sample of 200 netflix offerings, 61 were shows.
find a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of all netflix offerings which are movies.

Goal: Unknown population parameter: p=prop of shows

Estimate of sample proportion: $\hat{p} = \frac{61}{200} \approx 0.31$

both tail areas outside of interval wil be 0.025, $z=qnorm(0.976) \approx 1.96$

$CI= \hat{p} \pm z SE$

** Means Ex
the sample mean length of a random sample of 100 netflix movies was 102 minutes with a sample sd of 27 minutes.
Compute a 90% confidence interval for the mean length of all netflix movies

Goal: unknown population parameter \mu = mean length of all netflix movies

estimate w/ sample mean of \overline{x}=102

use t distribution because of sample sd

t=qt(0.95,100-1)

interval: \overline{x} \pm t*SE

$SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{27}{100}$

** hypothesis means test
find if te mean length of netflix movies is significantly different from 1.5 hrs (\alpha=0.1)

H_0: \mu = 90, H_a: \mu \ne 90

*Rejection Region Approach*

t=qt(0.95,100-1)

$\frac{\overline{x}-90}{SE} = t$
