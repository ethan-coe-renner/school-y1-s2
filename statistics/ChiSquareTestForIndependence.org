* Is marijuana consumption related to BLM support
H_0: marijuana consumption and BLM support are independent

H_a: marijuana consumption and BLM support are dependent

*expected cell counts*

|                | None             | partial            | full               | total |
| consumed       | 5 * 37/115 = 1.6 | 41 * 37/115=13.2   | 69 * 37/115 = 22.2 |    37 |
| never consumed | 5 * 78/115 =3.4  | 41 * 78/115 = 27.8 | 69 * 78/115 = 46.8 |    78 |
| total          | 5                | 41                 | 69                 |   115 |

*observed*

|                | none | partial | full |
| consumed       |    1 |       7 |   29 |
| never consumed |    4 |      34 |   40 |

calculate \Chi^2 (sum of formula for each cell): $\sum{}\frac{(obs-exp)^2}{exp}$

df = 2

in general, df = (# of rows - 1) * (# of cols - 1)

*rejection region*
\alpha = 0.05

\Chi_c = qchisq(0.95,2) = 5.99

7.7 > 5.99, reject H_0

*p-value*
\Chi^2 = 7.7

p-value = 1 - pchisq(7.7,2) = 0.02

0.02 < 0.05, reject H_0

there is a relationship between BLM support and MJ consumtion


| Null Hypothesis  | H_0: variables a and b are independent (variables must be categorical)                             |
| test statistic   | $\Chi^2=\sum{}\frac{(obs-exp)^2}{exp}$, where $exp = column total * \frac{row total}{grand total}$ |
| rejection region | reject if \X^2> \Chi_c, $\Chi_c = qchisq(1-\alpha,df)$                                             |
| p-value          | p-value = 1-pchisq(\Chi^2,df), reject if p-value < \alpha                                          |
