* basics

regression used to make predictions

* ggplot
#+begin_src R
  ggplot(baseball, aes(x=RD,y=W))+geom_point()+
    geom_smooth(method=lm,col="red")+labs(x="Runs Over Opponent",y="wins")
#+end_src

* Finding equation of a regresnsion line

y = outcome, response, dependent variable

x = feature, predictor, independent variable

model: $\hat{y} = mx + b$

#+begin_src R
  lm(y~x,data=dataset)
#+end_src

gives intercept and slope (RD)

intercept: value of y when x is 0

slope: $\frac{\Delta{}y}{\Delta{}x}$

* Hypothesis test for 0 slope
H_0: slope of regression = 0
H_a: slope of regression \ne 0

*Primary test for relationship between 2 numeric variables*

#+begin_src R
  summary(lm(y~x,data=dataset))
#+end_src

* Prediction

got equation $\hat{y} = 0.1x+80.9$

How many wins does our model predit if we score 169 more wins than our opponents?

0.1(169)+80.9 \approx 99

* Predictions vs Reality
Residual = Actual - predicted

* Measuring the fit of regression line

R^2 = proportion of variance in y explained by the model

given in the summary code from above labeled "Multiple R-squared"

always between 0 and 1, 1 means the line is a stronger predictor
