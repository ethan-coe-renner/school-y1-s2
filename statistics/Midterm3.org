    #+begin_src R :results output
      sampleProp=121/328
      t=qt(0.95,327)
      se=sqrt((sampleProp * (1-sampleProp))/328)
      high=sampleProp + t * se
      low=sampleProp - t * se

      print(high)
      print(low)
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : [1] 0.4128492
    : [1] 0.3249557

    90% confidence that the population proportion is between 0.32 and 0.41

   2.
      #+begin_src R
        (sqrt(121/328 * (1-121/328))/0.02)^2
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS:
      : 582.033573765616

      we would need a samle of 583 shots to have less than 0.02 margin of error

2. 

    1. We need to use a t distribution because we are given the *sample* standard deviation as opposed to the *population* standard distribution.
        The confidence interval would be narrower with a normal distribution.

    2. 
        #+begin_src R :results output
            p=19.5
            sd=5.8

            t=qt(0.875,87)

            high=p+sd*t
            low=p-sd*t

            print(high)
            print(low)
       #+end_src

       #+RESULTS:
       : [1] 26.21687
       : [1] 12.78313

       75% confidence that the population mean is between 12.7 and 26.2

3. 

   1. H_0: \mu = 7

      H_a: \mu \ne 7 

   2. 
       #+begin_src R
         school=read.csv("~/school/statistics/school.csv")

         null = 7

         sd = sd(school$Average.Sleep)
         mean = mean(school$Average.Sleep)

         t = (mean-null)/sd

         pvalue=2 * (1-pt(t,length(school$Average.Sleep)-1))
       #+end_src

       #+RESULTS:
       : 0.37734278450452

   3. I failed to reject the null hypothesis because p-value = 0.37 > 0.01

4. 

   1. H_0: p=0.5

      H_a: p>0.5

   2. 
       #+begin_src R :results output
         school = read.csv("~/school/statistics/school.csv")
         null = 0.5

         se = sqrt((null*(1-null))/length(school$On.campus))

         t=qt(0.95,length(school$On.campus)-1)

         high=null + t * se
         low=null - t * se

         print(high)
         print(low)
       #+end_src

       #+RESULTS:
       : [1] 0.5813775
       : [1] 0.4186225

   3.
      #+begin_src R
        school = read.csv("~/school/statistics/school.csv")

        mean=sum(school$On.campus == "Yes") / length(school$On.campus)
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS:
      : 0.653846153846154

      0.65 > 0.58 \therefore I reject the null and conclude that significantly more tha n50% of all students lived on campus in 2012.
