* Warm Up

4:1 mux truth table, based on s1, s0

| s_1 | s_0 | f   |
|-----+-----+-----|
|   0 |   0 | w_0 |
|   0 |   1 | w_1 |
|   1 |   0 | w_2 |
|   1 |   1 | w_3 |

$f = s_1's_0'w_0+s_1's_0w_1+s_1s_0'w_2+s_1s_0w_3$

* Problems
1. 32:1 mux has
   1. data inputs: 32
   2. select signals: 5
   3. outputs: 1
2. $f(a,b,c,d)=\sum{}m(2,4,5,7,12,13,14)

   4. the SOP makes more sense because it is cheaper. it requires 4 not, 4 and (2,3,4 input) and a 4 input or;
      the mux requires 4 ands but all are 4 input, 1 or, and 4 nots

      4(2) + 4(8+2) + 8+2 = 58
      SOP=48
