1. Ethan Coe-Renner
2. f(x_1 , x_2 , x_3) = \prod{}M(2,3,6) = =\prod{}M(010,011,110) = 

   = (x_1 + x_2' + x_3) (x_1 + x_2' + x_3') (x_1' + x_2' + x_3)
3. f(x_1 , x_2 , x_3) = (x_1 + x_2' + x_3) (x_1' + x_2 + x_3 ) (x_1' + x_2' + x_3)
   = (x_1 + x_2' + x_3) (x_1' + x_2 + x_3 ) (x_1' + x_2' + x_3) (x_1' + x_2' + x_3)

   combine terms 1, 3 and 2, 4

   = (x_2' + x_3) (x_1' + x_3 )
4. f(x_1 , x_2 , x_3) = \prod{}M(0,1,4,7)

   POS: 000 001 100 111

   SOP: 010 011 101 110

   Neither approach can simplify to terms with only 2 variables each.
   
   Therefore both will end up with the same simplified cost because there are not gates for each variable
   and three or/and gates of the same sizes.
   This means the choice of SOP vs POS does not matter in this case.
