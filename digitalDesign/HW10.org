1. 
    | clk | S | R | Q(t+1) |
    |-----+---+---+--------|
    |   0 | d | d | Q(t)   |
    |   1 | 0 | 0 | Q(t)   |
    |   1 | 0 | 1 | Q(t)   |
    |   1 | 1 | 0 | 1      |
    |   1 | 1 | 1 | 1      |

    Cost: 4 NAND (2 input) = 4 * 2(2) = 16

    Critical delay: 4\Delta{}t

3. the top part is a latch so Q_a is level sensitive

   the bottom two are flip-flops so Q_a and Q_c are both edge triggered.
