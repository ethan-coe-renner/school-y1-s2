   4:1 mux, b,c selects

   f =

   b'c'(a'd'0 + a'd1 + ad'0 + ad1)

   b'c(a'd'0 + a'd0 + ad'0 + ad0)

   bc'(a'd'1 + a'd1 + ad'1 + ad0)

   bc(a'd'0 + a'd1 + ad'0 + ad0)

   = b'c'(a'd) + b'c(0) + bc'(d') + bc(a'd)

   1. cost of mux: 2 NOT, 4 AND(2 in), 1 OR(4 in) = 2(2) + 4(2(2) + 2) + 2(4) + 2 = 38

   path delay = 3 (NOT, AND, OR)\Delta{}t

   1. I would expect the cost to increase because the number of gates increases.
      However the critical delay will stay the same because the longest path is the same regardless of the size of the mux.
