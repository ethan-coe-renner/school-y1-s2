* What are Prediction markets
Prediction markets are markets in which contracts are traded which resolve based on the outcome of events.

Ex. In the 2020 election, contracts were sold that could be redeemed for $1 if Trump won, and were worthless if he lost.
The market price reflects the expected value of the contract, which is calculated by P(Trump wins) * $1.
Therefore the price, as a fraction of $1, can be interpreted as a prediction of the probability that Trump will win.

- Efficient Market Hypothesis

(Wolfers 2006)

* Innovations
Some of the most recent innovations have come in the form of decentralized markets.
This usually comes in the form of cryptocurrency.

Decentralized markets have a number of advantages over centralized markets:
- Cost
- Geographical limitations
- Trust

* Difficulties with Decentralized Prediction Markets

- Resolving markets

In a decentralized market, there is no central authority to resolve the market, and you can't just trust people because they might have a lot of stake in the wrong outcome.

In "Augur: A Decentralized Oracle and Prediction Market Platform" (Alexander 2019) a number of researchers describe a solution to this problem.
The solution is beyond the scope of this talk, however the general idea is to have individuals stake reputation (in the form of a cryptocurrency) on the "correct" outcome.

* Uses for Prediction Markets
"Prediction markets have been used to forecast elections, movie revenues,
corporate sales, project completion, economic indicators and Saddam Husseinâ€™s demise." (Wolfers 2006)

Other uses include:
- Pentagon used markets to predict geopolitical risk
- Firms use prediction markets to predict R&D outcomes, product success, regulatory outcomes, etc.
- Predicting disease outbreaks

* Use in Politics

One particulary interesting use for prediction markets is detailed in Robin Hanson's "Shall We Vote on Values, But Bet on Beliefs?"
In it, Hanson describes a political system in which representative democracy is used to determine the values society wishes to maximize.
However, the particular policies that are implemented would be based on the outcome of a prediction market on which policy would maximize those values.

He argues this would be preferable to traditional democracy because:
- "Democracies fail largely by not aggregating available information."
- "It is not that hard to tell rich happy nations from poor miserable ones."
- "Betting markets are our best known institution for aggregating information."

* Perverse Incentives
A perverse incentive is when a system creates incentives which are contrary to the intentions of the system's designers.

A classic example of perverse incentives in prediction markets are *Assassination Markets*.

- Jim Bell's "Assassination Politics" describes in some detail how such a system might work.

* Regulation
One popular regulation strategy is to limit the amount of money one can spend on any contract. 
- PredictIt
This reduces the severity of any perverse incentives.

Problems
1. It can be difficult to know beforehand what kinds of markets will create such incentives
2. Cryptocurrency
3. Reduce effectiveness
