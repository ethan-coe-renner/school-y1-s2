#+title: Keeping the Competition Out
#+author: Ethan Coe-Renner

* Introduction
- consumers love competition
- Competetors hate competition
- profits rise if a firm can keep competition out
- there are many ways firms try to do this
  
* Taxicab Medallions
- NYC number of taxicabs limited to 1 cab for 600 people
- Every (legal) taxi must have a taxi medallion on the car's hood
- medallions can be bought and sold by individuals
- at time of writing 1 medallion cost $600,000, which, of course, doesn't include the taxi itself
- in 2014 1 medallion cost over $1 million

* How it works
- Q1: when government reduces the number of firms in an industry, what happens to the supply of the good they produce?
- supply decreases, meaning the firms can charge a higher price
- Telephones
  - before 1984, long and short distance calls were regulated by the federal government.
  - in 1984, long distance calls were deregulated, resulting in a 40% drop in inflation adjusted rates, while local phone rates rose by 40%
  
* Ridesharing
- Uber and lyft have cut into the (artificial) monopoly taxicabs had in NYC and elsewhere
- since the two companies began operating, taxicab medallions have depreciated in value by 40%
- also, it is much easier to get around in NYC
- this illustrates the point that government intervention in the economy, at least when used to stifle competition, is harmful to consumers

* Occupational Licensing
- today (as of writing), over 11 hundred occupations require a license in at least one state
  - secretaries (Georgia)
  - wallpaper hangers (California)
  - 30% of the workforce
- Other examples
  - number of law schools (except in california) is capped by law
  - Real estate agents have to be licensed, and they are prevented from lowering prices even if they provide less services (12 states)
    - US real estate commission is 5.1%, in other countries average is 3.6%
  - these help current lawyers and real estate agents, but hurt their customers
  
* Hair Braiding Licenses
- Braiding salons are a threat to conventional beauty salons as they can provide similar services more cheaply
- agents of the California Barbering and Cosmetology Board raid salons of unlicensed hair braiders
- cosmetology school costs $6000 and 1600 hours of training (more than to become a police or medical technician in many states, 664 hours in CA (cnn))
  - In Utah, cost is $16000 and 2000 hours
  - none of the schools teach hair braiding
